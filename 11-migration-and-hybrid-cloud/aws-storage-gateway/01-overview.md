# AWS Storage Gateway

## Simple definition

AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that connects your on-premises environment to AWS storage services.

In simple words, it helps local servers and applications keep their familiar setup while storing data in AWS.

## Core idea in plain English

Think of AWS Storage Gateway as a bridge between your data center and AWS.

A company may still have servers, backup software, or file shares on-premises. Storage Gateway helps those systems keep working while sending data to AWS for storage, backup, archiving, or recovery.

That is why Storage Gateway is called a hybrid service.

## Main use cases

### 1. File storage in AWS with local access

A company wants users in the office to keep using shared folders, but store the data in AWS.

### 2. Backup to the cloud

A business wants to move backups from expensive local storage or physical tapes into AWS.

### 3. Disaster recovery

A company wants data stored in AWS so it can recover faster if the local environment fails.

### 4. Extend local storage capacity

An on-premises application needs more storage, but the company does not want to keep buying hardware.

### 5. Archive old data cheaply

A business wants to keep old data for compliance or long-term retention using AWS storage tiers.

## Key features

 Connects on-premises systems to AWS storage
 Supports file, block, and virtual tape use cases
 Local caching for low-latency access to frequently used data
 Works with existing applications and backup software
 Helps reduce on-premises storage costs
 Supports secure data transfer and encryption
 Integrates with AWS monitoring and security services
 Useful for backup, migration, archive, and hybrid storage

## Gateway types you should know

### File Gateway

File Gateway gives on-premises applications file-based access to data in AWS.

You usually access it using common file protocols like NFS or SMB.

There are two important file-based options

#### Amazon S3 File Gateway

 Stores files as objects in Amazon S3
 Good for file shares, backups, data lakes, and cloud-backed file storage

#### Amazon FSx File Gateway

 Provides low-latency access to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
 Good for Windows file shares and file-based application migrations

### Volume Gateway

Volume Gateway gives on-premises applications block storage using iSCSI.

This is useful when applications expect volumes, not files.

It is a better fit for applications that need block-level storage semantics.

### Tape Gateway

Tape Gateway presents virtual tapes to existing backup software.

It is designed for organizations that want to replace physical tape systems with AWS storage while keeping their current backup workflows.

## How it works

1. You deploy Storage Gateway as a gateway appliance in your environment.
2. Your local servers connect to it using familiar protocols such as SMB, NFS, or iSCSI.
3. The gateway stores frequently used data in a local cache for faster access.
4. The actual data is stored in AWS storage services such as Amazon S3, Amazon FSx, or AWS-backed virtual tape storage.
5. You manage and monitor the service through AWS tools.

So the user or application often feels like it is using local storage, while AWS is doing the heavy storage work in the background.

## Why it is important for the exam

AWS Cloud Practitioner questions often test whether you understand

 Hybrid cloud versus fully cloud-native services
 When a company wants to keep on-premises systems but use AWS storage
 The difference between file, block, and tape storage models
 Which service helps with backup, archive, disaster recovery, and storage extension

The most important exam idea is this

 AWS Storage Gateway is for connecting on-premises environments to AWS storage.

If the question mentions

 existing data center
 local servers
 physical tapes
 hybrid storage
 backup to AWS
 low-latency local access with cloud-backed storage

then Storage Gateway should come to mind.

## Related AWS services and differences

### AWS Storage Gateway vs AWS DataSync

 Storage Gateway = ongoing hybrid access to AWS storage
 DataSync = fast data transfer or migration between storage systems

Use Storage Gateway when you want a persistent bridge.
Use DataSync when you want to move data.

### AWS Storage Gateway vs Amazon S3

 Amazon S3 = object storage in AWS
 Storage Gateway = a way for on-premises systems to use AWS storage like S3

S3 is the storage service.
Storage Gateway is the hybrid connector.

### AWS Storage Gateway vs Amazon EBS

 Amazon EBS = block storage for EC2 instances
 Volume Gateway = block storage interface for on-premises applications

EBS is for AWS cloud servers.
Volume Gateway is for hybrid use cases.

### AWS Storage Gateway vs Amazon EFS or Amazon FSx

 EFS  FSx = managed file systems in AWS
 Storage Gateway = lets on-premises systems access AWS-backed storage in familiar ways

### AWS Storage Gateway vs AWS Backup

 AWS Backup = centralized backup management service
 Storage Gateway = provides hybrid storage access and can support backup workflows

### AWS Storage Gateway vs Snow Family

 Snowball  Snow Family = physical devices for moving or processing data in edge or disconnected environments
 Storage Gateway = network-connected hybrid storage service

If the question is about continuous hybrid storage access, choose Storage Gateway.
If it is about shipping a device for data transfer, think Snow Family.

## Common exam traps

### Trap 1 Confusing Storage Gateway with DataSync

DataSync is mainly for transferring data.
Storage Gateway is for hybrid storage access.

### Trap 2 Forgetting that it is a hybrid service

Storage Gateway is not mainly for cloud-only applications.
It is for connecting on-premises systems to AWS.

### Trap 3 Mixing up file, block, and tape

 File Gateway = file access
 Volume Gateway = block storage
 Tape Gateway = virtual tapes for backup software

### Trap 4 Thinking Tape Gateway is for modern app storage

Tape Gateway is for backup and archive workflows, not normal application storage.

### Trap 5 Thinking Storage Gateway replaces every storage service

It does not replace S3, EBS, EFS, or FSx.
It helps on-premises systems use AWS storage services.

## Easy real-world example

A company has an office with local backup software that still writes to tapes.

Instead of buying more physical tapes and tape libraries, the company uses Tape Gateway.
The backup software still sees tape, but the data is actually stored in AWS.

This saves hardware cost, improves durability, and makes long-term archiving easier.

Another example
A company has office users who need a shared folder.
They use File Gateway so users still access files like a normal file share, but the data is backed by AWS storage.

---

## Final summary

AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid storage bridge between on-premises systems and AWS.

It helps companies keep existing applications, file shares, and backup tools while using AWS for storage, backup, archive, and recovery.

The main thing to remember is

 File Gateway = file access
 Volume Gateway = block storage
 Tape Gateway = virtual tapes

When an exam question mentions on-premises infrastructure that needs to connect to AWS storage, Storage Gateway is often the answer.

---

## Short exam answer

AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that connects on-premises environments to AWS storage for file, block, and tape-based workloads.

## Memory trick

Storage Gateway = gateway from your data center to AWS storage.

Or even shorter

File, Volume, Tape = local style, AWS storage underneath.

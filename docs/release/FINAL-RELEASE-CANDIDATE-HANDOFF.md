# Final Release-Candidate Handoff

## Repository

AWS CPP and SAA Study Notes

## Branch

`audit/phase5-official-coverage`

## Base Commit

`f24d1b6 update`

## Working-Tree Status

Dirty by design and unstaged. The final manifest is the authority for the exact changed and untracked paths.

## Release-Candidate Scope

Final verification, one targeted Support-freshness correction, QA evidence, temporary-helper cleanup, and human handoff. No new project phase or certification content scope was created.

## Phase 6 Closure Result

Passed: 54 unique authoritative IDs, 54 completed reconciliation rows, no invented ID, no blocker, and concrete evidence for every row.

## Phase 7 Result

Passed: all 19 mandatory Phase 7 records and five initial release records exist; no critical or high-severity release blocker remains.

## Final Validation Result

Passed with documented medium and low limitations. See `FINAL-VALIDATION-RESULTS.md`.

## Changed Files

Seven tracked updates or deletions are recorded exactly once in `RELEASE-CANDIDATE-MANIFEST.csv`.

## Untracked Files

Twenty-nine untracked Phase 7 and release-candidate records are recorded exactly once in the manifest.

## Files Excluded from Commit

Two temporary-script artifacts are marked `include_in_commit=no`; the human should retain their tracked deletions without restoring their contents. Ignored caches, `.pyc`, local configuration, credentials, editor metadata, and backups also remain excluded.

## Critical-Risk Review

No potentially sensitive or critical-risk file was identified.

## High-Risk Review

Twenty-seven manifest rows are high risk: root navigation, final validation, badge/ownership evidence, pricing and Support, AI, migration/product status, exam integrity, security, and the manifest. They require human review.

## CPP Readiness

The primary path resolves and is beginner-oriented. Backlog implementation is complete, but 51 task-map rows below complete depth remain explicit.

## SAA Readiness

Architecture decisions, failure domains, security, cost, migration, comparisons, and scenario reasoning are linked. Fifty-eight task-map rows remain below complete depth.

## Exam-Integrity Result

Passed: 37 relevant files reviewed, 0 suspected real-exam source, 0 dump, and 0 ambiguity flagged. Twenty-eight files lack explained answers and remain non-blocking editorial debt.

## Security and Secret-Scan Result

Passed: 0 secret, credential, private-key, token, local-configuration, or unexpected-binary finding.

## Known Limitations

See `KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md`, including incomplete task-map depth, answer explanations, reference-heading consistency, Mermaid rendering, and volatile facts.

## Remaining Non-Blocking Issues

- 28 knowledge checks without explained answers.
- 51 CPP and 58 SAA below-complete evidence rows.
- 13 reference-heading inconsistencies.
- 5 Mermaid files without automated rendering.
- Ongoing high-volatility fact review.

## Remaining Blocking Issues

None.

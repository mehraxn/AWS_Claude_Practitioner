# AWS Personal Health Dashboard (AWS Health)

## Simple Definition

AWS Personal Health Dashboard (AWS Health) is a service that shows the health status of AWS services and how AWS events may affect your specific AWS resources.

## Core Idea in Plain English

AWS tells you when something might impact your resources.

Instead of only showing global AWS problems, it shows issues related to your own account, such as scheduled maintenance or service disruptions.

## Main Use Cases

 Checking if AWS service issues affect your resources
 Getting alerts about scheduled maintenance
 Monitoring AWS outages that impact your account
 Planning operations around AWS maintenance windows

## Key Features

### 1. Account‑Specific Alerts

### 3. Event Details

Explains

### 4. Integration With Other Services

## How It Works

1. AWS detects an operational event.
2. AWS identifies which customers are affected.
3. AWS Health creates an event notification.
4. The event appears in your AWS Personal Health Dashboard.
5. You can view details and recommended actions.

## Why It Is Important for the Exam

 AWS Service Health Dashboard → Global AWS service status
 AWS Personal Health Dashboard (AWS Health) → Events affecting your account specifically

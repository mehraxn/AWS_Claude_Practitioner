# AWS Service Quotas

## Simple definition

AWS Service Quotas is a service that helps you view, manage, and request increases for AWS service limits.

In simple words, it shows you how much of an AWS resource you are allowed to use and helps you ask for more when needed.

## Core idea in plain English

AWS does not let every account use unlimited resources by default.

For example, there may be a limit on how many EC2 instances, VPCs, or Elastic IPs you can have in a Region. These limits are called service quotas.

AWS Service Quotas is the place where you can

 check those limits,
 see current usage for some services,
 and request a higher limit when allowed.

Think of it like a control panel for AWS limits.

## Main use cases

### 1. Check your AWS limits

Before launching many resources, you can check whether your account quota is high enough.

### 2. Request a quota increase

If you need more resources, you can request a higher quota for supported services.

### 3. Avoid deployment failures

A project may fail if you hit a limit. Service Quotas helps you catch that early.

### 4. Plan growth

As your application grows, you can monitor quotas and increase them before they become a problem.

### 5. Improve operational visibility

Teams can better understand account limits across services and Regions.

## Key features

### View service quotas

You can see quotas for many AWS services from one place.

### Request quota increases

For adjustable quotas, you can submit a request directly.

### AWS default and applied values

You may see the default quota and your current applied quota value.

### Region-specific visibility

Many quotas are different by Region, so you can check them Region by Region.

### Integration with CloudWatch and alarms

You can monitor quota usage and create alerts for some quotas.

### Central management support

It helps organizations manage and review limits more easily across environments.

## How it works

1. You open AWS Service Quotas in the AWS Management Console.
2. You choose an AWS service, such as EC2 or VPC.
3. You review the quota values for that service.
4. If the quota is adjustable, you can request an increase.
5. AWS reviews the request and may approve it depending on the quota type.

For some quotas, AWS lets you track usage as well. This is useful when you are getting close to the limit.

## Why it is important for the exam

For the Cloud Practitioner exam, the big idea is this

AWS resources are not unlimited by default.

You need to remember that

 accounts have limits,
 quotas may be per Region,
 some quotas can be increased,
 and AWS Service Quotas is the tool used to view and manage them.

Exam questions may describe a situation where a company cannot launch more resources or needs a higher limit. The correct answer is often AWS Service Quotas.

## Related AWS services and differences

### AWS Service Quotas vs AWS Trusted Advisor

 Service Quotas helps you view limits and request increases.
 Trusted Advisor gives recommendations and can warn about service limit usage in some cases.

So, Service Quotas is the main quota-management service, while Trusted Advisor is a broader advisory tool.

### AWS Service Quotas vs CloudWatch

 Service Quotas is for viewing and managing limits.
 CloudWatch is for monitoring metrics, logs, and alarms.

CloudWatch can help alert you when usage is close to a quota, but it is not the service where you manage the quota itself.

### AWS Service Quotas vs AWS Organizations

 Service Quotas deals with limits for AWS services.
 AWS Organizations helps manage multiple AWS accounts.

Organizations manages account structure and governance, not quota values.

### AWS Service Quotas vs AWS Support

Sometimes quota increases are handled through Service Quotas, but older or special cases may involve AWS Support.

For the exam, remember

 use Service Quotas to check and request increases,
 AWS Support may still be involved behind the scenes for approval.

## Common exam traps

### Trap 1 Thinking AWS resources are unlimited

They are not. Many services have quotas.

### Trap 2 Confusing quotas with billing

Service Quotas is about limits, not pricing or cost analysis.

### Trap 3 Confusing Service Quotas with CloudWatch

CloudWatch monitors. Service Quotas manages limits.

### Trap 4 Confusing Service Quotas with Trusted Advisor

Trusted Advisor gives recommendations. Service Quotas is the direct quota tool.

### Trap 5 Forgetting Regional limits

A quota in one Region may be different from another Region.

## Easy real-world example

A startup wants to launch many EC2 instances for a new application.

The team tries to deploy them, but the deployment fails because the account has reached its EC2 quota in that Region.

They open AWS Service Quotas, check the EC2 quota, and request an increase.

After the increase is approved, they can launch more instances.

## Final summary

AWS Service Quotas is the AWS service used to view, manage, and request increases for service limits.

It is important because AWS accounts do not have unlimited resources by default. If you hit a quota, your deployment may fail.

For the exam, remember that Service Quotas is the right answer when the question is about

 checking a limit,
 requesting a higher limit,
 or understanding resource usage boundaries.

## Short exam answer

AWS Service Quotas is a service that helps you view AWS service limits and request quota increases.

## Memory trick

Quotas = quantity cap.

If AWS asks, How much are you allowed to use think Service Quotas.

A simple memory line

Before you scale, check the quota wall.

# AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)

## Simple definition

AWS Cost and Usage Reports is an AWS billing feature that gives([docs.aws.amazon.com](httpsdocs.aws.amazon.comcurlatestuserguidewhat-is-cur.htmlutm_source=chatgpt.com))ources and services you used, how much you used, and what those usages cost.

## Core idea in plain English

Think of AWS Cost and Usage Reports as the raw billing file for your AWS account.

Instead of showing a simple summary chart, it gives you detailed line-by-line cost data. This helps companies analyze spending deeply, create custom reports, and understand where money is going.

## Main use cases

 Track detailed AWS spending
 Analyze usage by service, account, tag, or resource
 Build custom cost dashboards
 Investigate why a bill increased
 Charge costs back to teams or departments
 Export billing data for finance or reporting

## Key features

 Very detailed cost and usage data
 Can include line items for many AWS services
 Delivered automatically to an Amazon S3 bucket
 Can be used for custom analysis in tools like Athena, Redshift, or spreadsheets
 Can include resource IDs for deeper tracking
 Helps with cost allocation and trend analysis

## How it works

1. You enable AWS Cost and Usage Reports in the Billing and Cost Management area.
2. AWS generates billing and usage files for your account.
3. The report is delivered to an Amazon S3 bucket.
4. You analyze the files using tools such as Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, or other reporting tools.
5. You use the data to understand spending patterns, team usage, and optimization opportunities.

## Why it is important for the exam

For the Cloud Practitioner exam, you should know that AWS Cost and Usage Reports is for detailed raw billing data.

This matters because AWS often tests whether you can choose the correct billing tool

 Need a visual dashboard Use Cost Explorer
 Need budget alerts Use AWS Budgets
 Need the most detailed downloadable billing data Use Cost and Usage Reports

## Related AWS services and differences

### AWS Cost and Usage Reports vs Cost Explorer

 Cost and Usage Reports = detailed raw billing files
 Cost Explorer = visual charts, trends, filtering, and forecasting

### AWS Cost and Usage Reports vs AWS Budgets

 Cost and Usage Reports = analysis of detailed data
 AWS Budgets = set spending or usage limits and receive alerts

### AWS Cost and Usage Reports vs AWS Pricing Calculator

 Cost and Usage Reports = shows actual past and current usagecost data
 AWS Pricing Calculator = estimates future AWS costs before deployment

### AWS Cost and Usage Reports vs Billing Dashboard

 Cost and Usage Reports = deep detailed exportable billing data
 Billing Dashboard = simple billing overview in the AWS console

## Common exam traps

 Do not confuse it with Cost Explorer. Cost Explorer is easier to read, but CUR is much more detailed.
 Do not choose CUR when the question asks for alerts. Alerts are usually AWS Budgets.
 Do not choose CUR when the question asks for a cost estimate before building. That is AWS Pricing Calculator.
 If the exam says most detailed billing data, the answer is usually AWS Cost and Usage Reports.

## Easy real-world example

A company has five teams using AWS.

At the end of the month, the finance team wants to know

 which team used the most services,
 which resources caused the highest charges,
 and why the bill increased.

They use AWS Cost and Usage Reports to export detailed billing data into Amazon S3, then query it to break down costs by team, service, and resource.

## Final summary

AWS Cost and Usage Reports is the AWS tool for getting the most detailed cost and usage data.

It is best when you need raw billing files for deep analysis, custom reporting, and cost allocation. It is not mainly a dashboard tool and not mainly an alerting tool.

## Short exam answer

AWS Cost and Usage Reports provides the most detailed available AWS billing and usage data, usually delivered to Amazon S3 for deep analysis and custom reporting.

## Memory trick

CUR = Complete Usage Record

Remember it like this

 C = Costs
 U = Usage
 R = Raw report

So when the exam says most detailed billing data, think CUR.
